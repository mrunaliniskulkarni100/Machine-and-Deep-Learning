# Machine-and-Deep-Learning


## Python

Most of this (If not all) is implemented in Python.
Please make sure that you have Python 2.7/3.5 installed by running:

`python -V`

If this outputs the Python Version, you have Python installed.


## Libraries

Checkout the Libraries Folder. I have used most of these Libraries. Please install all the basic libraries.
