## Python

Most of this (If not all) is implemented in Python.
Please make sure that you have Python 2.7/3.5 installed by running:

`python -V`

If this outputs the Python Version, you have Python installed.

Else, head over to [Python Home Page](https://www.python.org/), to download the latest version of Python.


## pip

pip is a package management system used to install and manage software packages written in Python. Many packages can be found in the Python Package Index. Python 2.7.9 and later, and Python 3.4 and later include pip by default. 

### How to install pip

First check if you already have installed `pip` using command

`pip -V`

If you have downloaded Python from https://www.python.org/, you already have `pip` and `setuptools` installed.

Else, head over to the [Pip Installation](https://packaging.python.org/guides/installing-using-linux-tools/), to see how to install pip.

### pip Install Error(Linux)

Sometimes, pip doesn't install a package due to permission error. To resolve this error, use `sudo` before the pip install.

## Libraries

Checkout the Libraries Folder. I have used most of these Libraries. Please install all the basic libraries.
