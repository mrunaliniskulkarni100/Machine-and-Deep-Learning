# Important Libraries

## Numpy



## TensorFlow by Google

TensorFlowâ„¢ is an open source software library for numerical computation using data flow graphs. Nodes in the graph represent mathematical operations, while the graph edges represent the multidimensional data arrays (tensors) communicated between them. The flexible architecture allows you to deploy computation to one or more CPUs or GPUs in a desktop, server, or mobile device with a single API. TensorFlow was originally developed by researchers and engineers working on the Google Brain Team within Google's Machine Intelligence research organization for the purposes of conducting machine learning and deep neural networks research, but the system is general enough to be applicable in a wide variety of other domains as well.

## Universe by OpenAi

Universe is a software platform for measuring and training an AI's general intelligence across the world's supply of games, websites and other applications. This is the universe open-source library, which provides a simple Gym interface to each Universe environment.
