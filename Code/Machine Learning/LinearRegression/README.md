# Linear Regression

Linear Regression, or ordinary least squares (OLS), is the simplest and most classic linear method for regression. Linear Regression finds the parameters w and b that minimize the Squared Error between predictions and the true regression targets, y, on the training set. The mean squared error is the sum of the squared differences between the predictions and the true values. Linear regression has no parameters, which is a benefit, but it also has no way to control model complexity.
