# Naive Bayes Classifier

Naive Bayes classifiers are a family of classifiers that are quite similar to the linear models. However, they tend to be even faster in training. Naive Bayes classifier is slightly worse than that of linear classifiers like LogisticRegression.

Naive Bayes models look at each feature individually and collect simple per-class statistics from each feature. 

There are 3 kinds of Naive Bayes Classifier:

1. GaussianNB: This is applied to continuous data

2. BernoulliNB: This is applied to binary data. This is used in text classification.

3. MultinomialNB: This assumes count data. This is used in text classification.

## Libraries used:
