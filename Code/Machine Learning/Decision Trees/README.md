# Decision Trees

Decision Trees are widely used models for classification and regression tasks. Essentially, they learn a hierarchy of if/else questions, leading to a decision.

Learning a decision tree means learning the sequence of if/else questions that gets us to the true answer more quickly. In the machine learning setting, these questions are called tests. Usually data does not come in the form of binary yes/no features, but instead represented as continuous features such as in 2D dataset.
