# Dataset used

I have used the Fashion-MNIST dataset to train the Neural Network.

1. Go to their [GitHub Page](https://github.com/zalandoresearch/fashion-mnist) to download the Dataset.
2. After downloading the dataset, save it in `Convolutional Neural Network/data`
3. The program will manage, extracting the data from the dataset files.
